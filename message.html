    Gayatri…
I don’t even know where to begin, because every time I take your name, something inside me softens. It’s crazy how one person can become a whole feeling, a whole atmosphere, a whole reason for why my heart beats a little differently.

You know, sometimes I try to act normal, but the moment your name pops up on my screen… everything in me lights up like it’s Diwali inside my chest. I don’t even hide it anymore — you make me happy in a way nothing else does.

But let me say everything honestly today…

You have this magic I can’t explain.
The way you talk… the way you smile… even the way you get irritated sometimes—
God, it's adorable.
I flirt with you because you make me feel alive.
You make me want to pull you closer, tease you a little,
and then tell you how beautiful you look when you get angry.

Simple because it comes naturally.
Complicated because every time I fall for you, I fall a little deeper.

You are my comfort and my chaos.
My calm and my excitement.
The softness in my heart and the spark in my thoughts.

I don’t love you because I need someone.
I love you because I need you.

Sometimes I scroll through our chats,
just to feel that little connection again.
Sometimes I sit quietly and your face randomly appears in my mind,
and suddenly I miss you so much it hurts a bit.

People say missing someone is normal.
But missing you, Gayatri…
it feels like a part of my day goes silent until I hear something from you again.

I get angry when you ignore me…
I get angry when you don’t take care of yourself…
I get angry when you disappear without telling me…

But the truth is,
My anger is just love wearing a different emotion.
I’m not mad at you —
I’m mad because you matter.
Because you’re important.
Because your presence, your words, your attention…
they mean something to me.

It’s like something inside me stays unfinished when you’re not around.
You know that feeling when a song stops right before the best part?
That’s what it feels like when I don’t talk to you.

You’ve become this missing piece in my day,
and without you, everything feels a little empty…
a little quiet…
a little off balance.

You make me smile even on my worst days.
You make me blush even when you’re not trying.
You make me feel things I thought I’d forgotten.

Just the thought of you gives me strength.
Just a single message from you changes my whole mood.
Just imagining you beside me makes the world feel right again.

I want happiness with you.
I want stupid fights, cute apologies, long conversations, random calls…
I want to make memories with you that no one else can replace.
I want to annoy you, protect you, tease you, adore you—
all at the same time.

I want to see you smile because of me.
I want to hold your hand without saying anything.
I want to be the person who stays.
Because for me…
you’re worth staying for.

I flirt because I like you.
I care because you matter.
I get angry because I’m attached.
I miss you because you’ve become a habit.
I love you because you’re unforgettable.
And I’m incomplete without you because you’re a part of me now.

You’re not just a chapter in my life.
You’re the story I want to continue writing.

And I want you in my life — not just for now, but for as long as we’re allowed to exist in each other’s world.

I Love Youuuu!! Lovee Yuhhh Sooo Much!!! Raani!!!
